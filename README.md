## Personal Website - Overview
---
For the creation of my personal website, I made a homepage called "index.html" with a moving track of pictures that link to invividual projects when clicked on. The purpose of this project is to have a single location showing off previous projects that I can link in my resume. It's one thing to say, "I know Python, C++, Swift, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.," but I wanted a location to group and display all my projects that anyone could explore at a glance.


## Project Structure 
---
The project files and folders are organized as follows:
```

+-- README.md
+-- index.html      
+-- pages        
    +-- template.html      // The default template used by each project page
    +-- coming-soon.html 
    +-- contact.html
+-- scripts
    +-- gesture.js         // Script to control paralax page movement effect
    +-- poke-scripting.js  
    +-- projects.json      // Data file for easy project addition and DRY implementation
    +-- projects.js        // Script to dynamically fill the template with json data
+-- styles
    +-- styles.css
    +-- poke-style.css
    +-- ...                // Various stylings for different device sizes
+-- media
    +-- ...                // Contains and organizes all site images 

```


## Development Environment
---
The project was written in VS Code for mac using JSON, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Future Improvements
---
- I plan to update the website each time I complete a project. I made the webpage with scalability in mind.
- Adding more JavaScript effects would be nice. Smoothing out some quirks and adding interest.
- I wanted to add gifs to explain the old projects, but ran out of time researching it and settled with just pictures, which works, but I'd like to go back to add some video elements.
